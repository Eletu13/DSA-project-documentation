-  Scale ratings (e.g., 1-5 stars) if necessary.
4.Remove duplicates
-  Eliminate duplicate reviews.
5. Data transformation
  -  Convert data into suitable format for analysis (e.g., pandas dataframe).


### Tools Used 

-  SQL ( for quering and data slicing
-  Microsoft excel( for cleaning
-  Power BI( for visual analytic and dashboard
-  GitHub ( version control and hosting


### Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
